A PDM plugin that packs your packages into a zipapp

## Requirements

pdm-packer works with Python >=3.9 and PDM >=2.19

## Installation

You can install the plugin directly by:

```bash
$ pdm plugin add pdm-packer
```

If you have installed PDM with the recommended tool `pipx`, add this plugin by:

```bash
$ pipx inject pdm pdm-packer
```

Or if you have installed PDM with `pip install --user pdm`, install with `pip` to the user site:

```bash
$ python -m pip install --user pdm-packer
```

Otherwise, install `pdm-packer` to the same place where PDM is located.

## Usage

```
$ pdm pack [common-options] [pack-options]
```

**Common Options:**

`-h, --help`

> show this help message and exit

`-v, --verbose`

> -v for detailed output and -vv for more detailed

`-g, --global`

> Use the global project, supply the project
> root with `-p` option

`-p PROJECT_PATH, --project PROJECT_PATH`

> Specify another path as the project root,
> which changes the base of pyproject.toml and `__pypackages__`

**Pack Options:**

`-m MAIN, --main MAIN `

> Specify the console script entry point for
> the zipapp

`-o OUTPUT, --output OUTPUT`

> Specify the output filename. By default the file name
> will be inferred from the project name.

`-c, --compress`

> Compress files with the deflate method, no
> compress by default

`--pyc, --compile`

> Compile source into pyc files

`--no-py`

> Remove the .py files in favor of .pyc files

`-i INTERPRETER, --interpreter INTERPRETER`

> The Python interpreter path, default: the
> project interpreter

`--exe`

> Create an executable file. If the output file
> isn't given, the file name will end with
> .exe(Windows) or no suffix(Posix)

## Examples

```bash
# Create with default name(<project_name>.pyz) and console_script as the __main__.py
pdm pack
# Create an executable file
pdm pack --exe
# Create with custom __main__.py and filename
pdm pack -o app.pyz -m app:main
```

## Caveats

1. If the result zipapp contains binaries, it can only be deployed to the platforms with the same abi, any cross-abi usage of that app might expect a failure.
2. Any console scripts except for what is given to `--main` will be lost.
3. The .exe file is different from what is produced by `pyinstaller` in the way that it doesn't embed a Python interpreter. This means you have to install a Python with exactly the same version on the deployment platform.
4. If you have code to run in your project, the project itself should be installed into `__pypackages__` as well. Make sure you have set a project name in `pyproject.toml`.

## About executable zipapp

By default, zipapp is created with `.pyz` suffix. On Windows, if you have associted `.pyz` files with Python program, you can run the app by double-clicking the file in the explorer. But if you create the app with `--exe` turn on, you can have a .exe file on Windows and an **executable** file
on Unix-like systems, so that the app can be executed without a `python` command prefixing it and
no matter you assoicated the file exensition properly or not.
